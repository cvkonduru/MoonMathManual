Integers :
    Integers are also known as Whole numbers, these are the numbers that can be written without fractional part
    Examples of the numbers that are not integers are : 2/3, 1.2 and -1280.006

    We use the symbol "Z" as a short for the set of all integers.

    Integers vs Whole Numbers:
        Integers include both negative and positive numbers including zero that are not decimals and fractional numbers
        Whole Numbers are just a set of non-negative numbers inluding zero that are not decimals and fractional numbers
    
    Z = {...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,....}

Absolute Value : Absolute value of an integer is always a non-negative number. It's denoted by |x| where x is eitehr +ve or -ve. and always yields a +ve value of x 
    Eg: |4| = 4
        |-4| = 4

We use the symbol N for the set of all +ve integers, they are usually called Natural Numbers.
Natural numbers don't have a zero.
We use N0 for the set of all non-negative integers. This means N does not contain 0 and N0 contains a 0.
    N := {1,2,3}
    N0 := {0,1,2,3}

Rational Numbers : Rational numbers are alwasy represented as a set of fractions n/m.
                    Where n is in the set of integers Z and m is in the set of natural numbers N.
                    There must be no other fraction n'/m' and natural number K which is in set N with k!= 1

The sets N, Z, Q have a notion of addition and multiplication defined on them.
